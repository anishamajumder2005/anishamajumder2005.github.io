Review notes for Goodwyn assorted tea collection, ordered from worst to best:

 * <font color="green">Green tea</font>this tea could have been stronger. the after taste was rather bitter leading to an over all distasteful experience. This tea just did not meet my expectations from a green tea, having tried other alternatives from both Goodwyn and other brands.
