## moneyball hypothesis testing
* make a hypothesis, counter check it, try to disprove it.
* resist the urge to solve the problem
* if you are not sure, wont get funded, cut it out.
* is the tam big enough to work on it?
* start with data. hypothesis is your cause, based on effect
* dont ask questions that you already know answers for
* resist tangent questions. when in a group, try to follow the thread.
* big no no to ask leading questions
* listen to answers. dont lead them somewhere.
* be agile in your questions.
* try to prove the null hypothesis
* start with asking them what their experience is. this is not a leading question
* dont bucket/categorize people. resist classification early on
* ask them what they do about the problem currently?
* add metric to your solution hypothesis
* try avoiding being married to your solution. thats how shelfware is created.

## Building Personas

* moneyball guides your goals
* Always remember the persona when you pitch the goals
* know your non-goals
* basically, competitive landscape is an opportunity to identify the eco system
