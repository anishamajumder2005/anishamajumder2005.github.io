## Immersion FAQ

- **Is stay and food covered by host school during our immersion stay?**
  
  *Answer:* Most of the food will be taken care i.e. Breakfast, lunch and tea for the class dates.  Some of the dinners from past experience may not be provided by the host schools as they would like the students to explore the city. Stay also will be covered by the host college.

- **What are the dates for immersion at SMU?**
  
  *Answer:* As per latest update from Kavita, it could be either of the dates - Feb 2nd to 10th, 2018 or Feb 9th to 17th, 2018. For exact dates we are yet to receive the confirmation from SMU.
