## Immersion FAQ

- **Is stay and food covered by host school during our immersion stay?**
  
  *Answer:* Most of the food will be taken care i.e. Breakfast, lunch and tea for the class dates.  Some of the dinners from past experience may not be provided by the host schools as they would like the students to explore the city. Stay also will be covered by the host college.

- **Can I get my spouse?**
  
  *Answer:* Yes, at your own expense. You will have to contact the hotel directly
